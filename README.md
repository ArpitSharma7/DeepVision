Model - Free Approach:

Please download the Model-free approach's trained models zip file from Gooogle Drive using the link below

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r54lnyTCAFBg8nuIhWiYmGyoUdDFmNTK

and extract the models into the same directory as the `main.py` file and run the `main.py` file with optional arguments such as File Input Path and `.obj` output path.

Example: `python3 main.py "PATH_TO_IMAGE.jpg" "OUTPUT_.obj_FILE_PATH"`

Model - Based Approach:

Output of `Model_Based.py` are the predicted vertices which need to be input to the file `visualiseobj.m` to generate the 3D `.obj` file
